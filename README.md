### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick, I'm a software engineer with over 6 years of experience building performant, simple, and elegant UIs. I've worked on a variety of applications, primarily working with React, React Native, Node JS, and GraphQL. 

Some previous products and companies I've worked for in the past include: 
- [Fold](https://foldapp.com/) 
- [Urbit](https://urbit.org/)
- [SkySpecs](https://skyspecs.com/)
- [Sift](https://www.justsift.com/)

Some interesting side projects I've worked on: 
- [react-native-alphabet-slider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-alphabet-slider)
- [pleb chat](https://pleb.chat/)
- [React music visualizer](https://github.com/nprz/react-music-visualizer)
- [React Game of Life](https://github.com/nprz/game-of-life)
